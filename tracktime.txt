9:13AM Currently going back through lessons to get Jest set up and running properly
10:00AM Still having issues with Jest VS Code extension
10:30AM Will try reinstalling extension again. Working now, onto writing tests.
11:00AM Taking lunch.
12:05PM had to do a math refresher... whoops
12:35PM reading up on beforeEach() in lessons to DRY code and tests
1:00PM I realized I want the age to be a whole number, not a decimal. And specifically I want the number rounded down. Currently looking up how to do that.
  I think I found what I want, math.floor() https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor
2:15PM my business logic can deinitely be refactored, just trying to figure out how. Tried a loop, didn't work.
3:00PM taking 15
3:25PM keep trying to refactor, can't seem to figure it out. Will move on to check if age has surpassed life expectancy
3:50PM at this point all required functionality is in place. Looks like I still need template literals though, need to figure out where to put those.
3:55PM added template literal, but it broke last test. Won't commit until fixed.
4:10PM figured the template literal out. Now just trying to refactor, will leave commented out code to go over with a teacher.
